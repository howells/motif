// Single root config for the whole monorepo, per the @howells/lint README's
// mixed-monorepo pattern (one root config extending the largest needed preset,
// with per-glob overrides for narrower packages). A single root config is also
// required mechanically: `options.typeAware` is only legal in the root config,
// while per-package turbo runs (`howells-check .` from a package dir) discover
// this file by walking upward, and root-cwd runs (lint-staged / pre-commit) read
// it directly — so both contexts resolve the same configuration.
//
// Lane choice: `react` (not `core`) because apps/cli's Studio screens are
// genuine React (.tsx) rendered through ink, keeping hook-correctness rules
// (rules-of-hooks, exhaustive-deps, jsx-key) and no-generic-component-suffix.
// React Doctor's rules, however, target react-dom web apps: on ink (terminal
// renderer, no DOM, its own reconciler) rules like rerender-functional-setstate,
// no-giant-component, prefer-useReducer, no-event-handler, and react-compiler
// fire as noise rather than real defects, and the node-only packages have no
// React at all. Per MIGRATIONS.md they are disabled as a documented migration
// exception with a removal path.
