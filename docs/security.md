# Motif Security Notes

## Authentication

Motif uses fal.ai API-key authentication. `FAL_KEY` is the primary public environment variable. The CLI can also read `apiKey` from `~/.motif/config.json`, but `FAL_KEY` takes precedence.

`@howells/motif-sdk/image` (the provider-agnostic image gen+edit layer) reads four provider environment variables, one per adapter: `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` (google, default provider), `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`, and `FAL_KEY`. `MotifImageConfig` can override any of these per client; only the key for the provider actually in use is required.

Use environment variables for headless or agent use. Do not print or commit real values for any of these four keys in logs, test output, issue comments, or source control.

## Local History Exposure

The CLI stores local generation history in `~/.motif/history.json`. It can contain prompts, costs, model names, timestamps, and local file paths.

Treat any process able to read `~/.motif/` as able to read local prompts and output paths.

## Ephemeral Generations

`motif --ephemeral` is local-first after generation:

- sends fal `X-Fal-Store-IO: 0`
- downloads the output to disk before deletion
- skips local Motif history
- deletes fal request IO payloads when fal returns a `request_id`

This is not full anonymity. Billing records, service logs, request metadata, already-uploaded input files, and local output files may still exist. Use it for disappearing generated media, not for secret handling.

## Image Layer Trust Boundary

`@howells/motif-sdk/image`'s `edit()` accepts `images` and `mask` as raw bytes, a base64 string, or a string URL. When a value is a remote `http(s)://` URL, the provider fetches it — on some providers (OpenAI) that fetch happens from the local process running the SDK. Applications that accept untrusted user-supplied image URLs should fetch and validate them before passing the result to `edit()`, rather than passing the URL straight through.

## Live Fal Calls

Live generation spends money. Agents should use `--dry-run` or mocked tests by default. Run `RUN_FAL_CANARY=1` tests only when explicitly requested.
